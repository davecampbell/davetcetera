It ignores the decades of foundational work that made computing possible — and the broader truth that information, not hardware, is the subject. The better question is: what does IT do? It captures, processes, stores, transmits, and retrieves information. The machinery changes; the mission doesn't.Define IT by what it does, not what it is made of:
Any technology whose primary purpose is to handle information — acquiring, storing, processing, transmitting, or displaying it.
This immediately includes:
Telegraphs and telephone switches
Radio and television broadcasting infrastructure
Punch card systems (pre-electronic)
Modern computing, networking, and AI
Why this works: It's technology-agnostic and future-proof. When something new arrives (quantum computing, biological computing), you can ask "does it handle information?" rather than "does it look like a computer?"Trace IT back to its intellectual origins rather than its commercial ones.Key waypoints:
1840s — Telegraph: the first system to separate information from a physical carrier (the message from the messenger)
1876 — Telephone: real-time voice as data
Bell Labs (1920s–1970s) — Transistor, information theory, Shannon's entropy, error correction, signal processing. This is arguably the true birthplace of modern IT
1948 — Claude Shannon's A Mathematical Theory of Communication — the foundational paper that defines information mathematically and underpins all digital systems
1950s–60s — Mainframe computing emerges from this lineage, not apart from it
1970s–present — Personal computing, internet, mobile, cloud
The takeaway: computers didn't create IT; IT created computers. The field existed before the transistor.Information technology is a subset of the broader field of information science, which includes:
How information is structured and classified (library science, ontologies, metadata)
How it is communicated (linguistics, semiotics, media studies)
How it is secured and controlled (cryptography, policy)
How it is used by humans (HCI, cognitive science)
This approach connects IT to disciplines that don't typically appear in a CS curriculum but are inseparable from it in practice. Cybersecurity, UX, data governance, and AI ethics all live here.IT doesn't exist in isolation — it's always embedded in social systems. Defining it purely as hardware or software misses the human layer.
IT is the ensemble of tools, practices, standards, and institutions that societies use to manage information.
This includes:
Postal systems (organised information routing)
Filing and records management
Standards bodies (IEEE, IETF, ISO) — the "invisible infrastructure"
Data centres as physical/social infrastructure
Why this is useful for teaching: It prevents students from thinking of IT as purely technical, which helps when addressing ethics, policy, and real-world impact.For a more rigorous framing: information, in the technical sense, is reduction of uncertainty. IT is any system that does this systematically.A traffic light is a rudimentary IT system. A spreadsheet is an IT system. So is a filing cabinet. What makes modern IT distinctive is:
Scale (billions of operations, billions of users)
Speed (real-time or near-real-time)
Programmability (the system can be reconfigured without physical change)
This framing lets you distinguish IT from other technologies while explaining why electronics and software became central — they maximise all three properties.Rather than one rigid definition, consider a layered scope:The "core" is what most people mean by IT in everyday use. The outer layers are what separate a practitioner from a technician. Open with Bell Labs — it's one of the most productive research environments in history and draws a direct line from physics → information theory → computing → the internet. It immediately challenges the "IT = computers" assumption. Use Shannon's definition of information as an early anchor. It's rigorous, non-circular, and gives students a durable mental model that survives technological change. Include one non-digital case study (e.g., the London postal system in the 1800s, or telephone exchange operators) to demonstrate that information systems predate electronics. Frame computers as an instantiation of IT, not its definition — the way an internal combustion engine is one instantiation of the idea of a heat engine. Acknowledge the fuzzy boundary — IT overlaps with electrical engineering, communications, media, and management. That's not a weakness; it's evidence that information is genuinely central to modern life.

Defining the structure of an ontology for IT historical artifacts, people, and relationships
Translating that ontology into a database architecture
Running the process collaboratively as a group (not just technically)
An ontology for a historical society isn't just a schema. It's a set of claims about what kinds of things exist, how they relate, and what the organization believes is worth tracking. Before touching any database tool, the committee needs to answer questions like:
What is the primary unit of record? (An artifact? A product line? A company? A person? An event?)
What does "historical significance" mean for this organization? (Who decides? By what criteria?)
How do we model influence and lineage? ("X led to Y" is a relationship, but there are many kinds of causality)
What is the boundary between canonical record and user contribution?
These are editorial and philosophical questions, not technical ones. The database follows from the answers.These examples are chosen because they faced the same core challenge: a community needed to agree on what things are before they could build anything.The Getty Research Institute maintains three controlled vocabularies — the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), and the Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN). These are among the most mature cultural heritage ontologies in existence.Relevance to ITHS:
They separate concept records (what a thing is, abstractly) from instance records (a specific object or person)
ULAN explicitly models relationships between artists: teacher/student, collaborator, influenced-by
The AAT has a formal process for community submissions and editorial review — this maps well to the "canonical vs. user submission" problem
Key lesson: They started with use cases, not with schema. "What questions do curators actually ask?" drove the structure.Reference: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/" target="_self">getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies</a>Wikidata is a general-purpose, community-maintained knowledge graph that underlies much of Wikipedia's structured data. Everything is a statement about an item, with properties and qualifiers.Relevance to ITHS:
It explicitly handles the "X influenced Y" problem via properties like influenced by, has part, follows, followed by
It has a clean separation between the item (canonical) and references (sourced claims)
It's entirely open and the data model documentation is excellent for learning how to think about these problems
Key lesson: Their data model evolved through community consensus via "WikiProjects" — groups that decided on the properties and structure for a domain (e.g., WikiProject Video Games, WikiProject Computing). This is a direct model for how the ITHS committee could work.<br>Reference: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProjects" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProjects" target="_self">wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProjects</a>The CHM has an online collection catalog that models hardware, software, people, and corporate history. They've had to solve the same "what is a canonical item?" question — is the canonical item the product design, the specific manufactured unit, or the product line?Relevance to ITHS:
Their distinction between artifact (a physical thing), object type (a class of thing), and lot (a collection) maps onto the ITHS problem of personal submissions vs. canonical records
They use a controlled vocabulary for significance/impact categories
Key lesson: They distinguish "what the object is" from "what the object means" — physical description is separated from historical narrative. This prevents the ontology from collapsing under the weight of interpretation.<br>Reference: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://computerhistory.org/collections/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://computerhistory.org/collections/" target="_self">computerhistory.org/collections/</a>Rick Prelinger's film archive and the broader Internet Archive have grappled with how to describe media items that have complex provenance chains — one film might be a copy of a copy, with annotations added by multiple hands.Relevance to ITHS:
The "user submits their copy or story of a canonical item" feature is essentially a provenance and versioning problem
Dublin Core and Schema.org (which IA uses heavily) are good prior art for simple, flat metadata that is still interoperable
Key lesson: Don't invent what already exists. Dublin Core, Schema.org, and SKOS cover a huge amount of the basic metadata and relationship vocabulary. Start by mapping your concepts to these before creating custom properties.Open Library models the same three-tier structure that ITHS likely needs:Key lesson: This hierarchy is well-understood and worth adopting directly. It cleanly separates the abstract thing from its instantiations.<br>Reference: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api" target="_self">openlibrary.org/developers/api</a>Based on the above examples, here is a rough sequence for how the committee might work:Before any data modeling, collect 10–15 concrete questions that the database should be able to answer. Examples:
"What hardware innovations came out of Xerox PARC and what products did they influence?"
"Show me a timeline of storage media from punch cards to SSDs"
"Who were the key engineers at DEC and what did they go on to build?"
"What members have submitted photos of Apple I machines?"
These become the test cases for the ontology. If a proposed schema can't answer them, it's incomplete.Working from the use cases, list the types of things and types of relationships that appear. Don't worry about the database yet. A whiteboard or a simple document is fine.Entity types might include: Person, Organization, Product, ProductLine, Concept/Innovation, Event, Document/Publication, PhysicalArtifact (user submission).Relationship types might include: EmployedBy, InventedBy, InfluencedBy, PrecededBy, PartOf, VersionOf, ContributedTo.Before designing custom schema, check if Schema.org, Wikidata properties, or the Getty AAT already have the concept. This saves time and enables future interoperability.Write entity definitions and relationship definitions in plain sentences before touching any technical notation. Example:
A Product is a commercially released item (hardware or software) with a known manufacturer and release date. A Product may have a PrecededBy relationship to another Product if the earlier Product was a direct technical or commercial predecessor.
Pick one domain (e.g., personal computers from 1975–1985) and build the schema for just that slice. Load a small amount of real data. See what breaks.Only after Phases 1–5 is it worth deciding: relational, graph, or hybrid? Document store? The answer should fall out of the data naturally, not be chosen up front.
What is the minimum viable set of entity types to launch with?
Who has editorial authority over canonical records vs. user submissions?
Is the goal a public-facing database, an internal curatorial tool, or both?
What existing databases (Wikidata, CHM catalog) should we link to rather than duplicate?
How do we handle contested history? (Competing claims of "who invented X") Share this doc with the committee for feedback
Schedule a use-case collection session (Phase 1)
Identify which committee members have worked with any of the reference systems above
Look at the existing Drupal 7 database schema — what entities does it already have?
